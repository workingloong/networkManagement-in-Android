The app is developed to manage the network of WiFi and Mobile data intelligently. 
The network logs of smartphone including location, network status time and so on is collected by the app.
Then the app will study the log to manage the on/off of cellphone. 
If you often surf Internet by WiFi in the someplace, the app will collect the log and learn those records. The next time you arrive here, the app will turn on WiFi and you need not turn on WiFi by your hand.
